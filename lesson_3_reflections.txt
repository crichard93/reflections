Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

A: You can work on it from any location with Internet access. 
Having a centralized location to store the project makes collaboration with others easier.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A: You do not want a file to change while you are updating it. You also may not want
certain files/commits from the remote repository on the local one.

Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

A: Forks are clones of repositories created by GitHub.  They are used when one does not have access to edit someone else's repository.

Clones are copies of a repository. These are used to locally pull a repository from GitHub, or to copy a repository to another location on a local machine.

Branches are simply a separate path of commits. These are used to test different versions of applications or to work on updates without affecting the master branch. 
The master branch should always be operational, while using other branches to test out changes without fear of ruining the master branch.

Q: What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

A: Most importantly, you have access to the latest changes to the remote, but you don't have to merge it on the spot. You can work on merging it in your own time if that's the intent.  It also ensures you are aware of any changes other developers have implemented to the code base.
